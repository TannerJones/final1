      "The value of fresh water has a huge impact on society including the most used form of renewable energy in hydropower production. The models look at the hydropower production from watershed-fed reservoirs and calculates differences and predictions based on varying factors such as land use and land cover change, evapotranspiration, infiltration and water retention and hydrologic cycles.  These changes affect the water yield and are calculated in the model. The calculated values for water yield can have significant impacts on the economy helping to calculate and predict values for stakeholders and consumers. "

      "There are three models that are used: 1) the water yield model, 2) the realized supply model, and 3) the hydropower production and valuation model. The first model determines the water yield per pixel by using the annual actual evapotranspiration per pixel and the precipitation per pixel. The second model determines the amount of water that flows into a reservoir. Water yield and water consumption are used for the realized supply model The input is based off of the land use and land cover type with the resulting water consumption. Each pixel in the watershed is either a contributing pixel or a use pixel. The third model helps determine that amount of power that is produced based on the amount of water present and determines the dollar value for that energy. for the lifetime of the reservoir as we as the current dollar value for the reservoir.  The value and energy is evaluted with theh landscape to  make output maps showing hydropower value and energy it  makes for the lifetime of watershed yeilds. Hydropower production model uses the previously mentioned water yield model and converts inflow volume to a per second rate and multiplying the kilowatt-hours with the hours in a year to produce the max electricity as the energy production rating."

The fields are: root restricting layer depth, precipitation, plant available water content, average annual reference evapotranspiration, land use/land cover, watersheds, subwatersheds, biophysical table, z parameter, and demand table. The first five on the list are all of the raster datasets required. They measure how much water is going into, coming out of, and being retained in the soil. The watersheds and subwatersheds are polygons that represent the exact location of where and how the water is retained and moves about in the region. The biophysical and demand tables are charts that explain the categories and attributes of the land use/land cover raster dataset. Lastly, the Z parameter measures how much water is expected to fall and be retained in the region in question and places in on a scale from 1 to 30. The Z parameter has been found in two distinct ways, the simpler is multiplying 0.2 and the number of rain events per year. and it could be an accurate depiction of the Z parameter.\n",
